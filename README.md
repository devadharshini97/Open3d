# Open3d
Creation of point clouds and meshes from RGBD images using Open3D.

I tried applying texture to the mesh generated from a single coffee mug image via Blender tool. I have attached the rendered output file and the screenshot in the corresponding folder (Single_Image_io)
Also, with global reconstruction and other algos tried to form a full 3D image using the given dataset but was only able to get a part of it. I am not sure if I need to do any changes with respect to alignments/transformation angles. Nevertheless, I have attached the result in the RANSAC folder.

As for mesh creation, I have used three types:
1. Alpha
2. Ball Pivot
3. Poisson

Created the meshes from the point cloud datasets obtained from both single image and multiple images.
